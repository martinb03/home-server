# Home Server Project
## Introduction
### What is a home server? 
A home server is a personal server you host within your own network, providing services such as file storage, media streaming, network-wide adblocking, and many more, all without relying on third-party cloud providers. It combines off-the-shelf hardware with open-source software to give you full control over your data and environment.
